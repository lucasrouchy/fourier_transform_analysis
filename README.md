# Fourier Transform Math Model
## Introduction
This project aims to read signals in binary and calculate the fourier sum at each index to spot the sine wave periods. 
There is also a performance testing analysis dimension to this project where the use MPI is enabled to manage the processors work in parallel.

## Graph Analysis
The performance graph demonstrates an almost perfect linear progression.
This indicates that the parallel fraction of the program is close to ideal.
